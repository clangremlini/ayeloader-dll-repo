All credits goes to software developers.
This repository removes cheats which are rarely used by @g42ftw. Also it adds a unique Osiris HvH edition (has a better interface and some additional backtrack/rage/anti-aim features but hasn't got any updates since September) and original Osiris is now being rebuilt every day).

## How to replace the original repo in FET Loader?
 1. Go to `%APPDATA%\FET Loader`
 2. Open `config.ini`
 3. Replace `cheatrepo=clangremlini/fetloader-dll-repo` with `cheatrepo=g42ftw/fetloader-dll-repo`
 4. Restart injector.

## What if I have an empty cheat list?
Make sure you entered variable without spaces and also recheck the repo link.
Go blame @g42ftw in Telegram if something goes wrong again and again.

## Cheat list

**OTC2** - Onetap V2 crack. Legit+Rage. *May be detected.* Not updating.

**OTC3** - Onetap V3 crack. Legit+Rage. *Undetected.* Not updating.

**Osiris** - IMO #1 legit cheat. Legit. *Undetected.* Updating constantly.

**Osiris HvH** - same but with rage features. Legit+Rage. *Undetected.* Main Osiris' configs are incompatible with this build.

**FTC** - fatality.win V1 crack. Legit+Rage. *May be detected.* Not updating.

**Aurora** - Aurora Free cheat. Legit. *Undetected.* Updating rarely.

## Good luck, my little hacker!
